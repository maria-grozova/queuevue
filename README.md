## UX and Design
### Site goals
Our web app will let users explore data analysis based on the wait times data for theme parks which will affect theme park and data enthusiasts by being able to learn some interesting trends, facts and enjoy a visual representation of this data.

### Direction
The principles and needs that were considered.

How might we:
- make it intuitive for users to explore the analysis of queue times and trends
- make it easy to understand the site's theme and purpose
- ensure the data displayed is clean and factual

### User stories
I identified 5 user user stories for the MVP.
The project progress was planned and tracked using Agile, as documented here in [GitHub Project]

### Schema design
***

### Design choices
I have always been a fan of theme parks and used to spend many hours playing RollerCoaster Tycoon on the family PC. While I continue to be a fan of visiting theme parks as an adult, there is a special place in my heart for the design aesthetic of the 1999 game and Windows 95 OS it used to run on. I chose to evoke the classic Windows 95 colour scheme in the QueueVue web app, adjusting the original background colour #2B8282 to a lighter #00ABAD to ensure colour contrast accessibility adherence with the use of black font.
